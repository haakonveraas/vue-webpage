    <h1>About</h1>
    <div class="paragraph">My name is Håkon Verås. I'm currently working as a Full Stack-developer at Dfind Consulting AS. I have a Bachelors degree
      in Mathematics and a Masters degree in Industrial Engineering from NTNU. Aside from my studies I was an Intern for different
      companies such as SEB, If P&C Insurance and Solution Seeker.

    <p class="paragraph">Apart from digging down into Software Development, I enjoy Mathematical Problem Solving and in general understanding
      how things work. After spending secondary school on playing video games and competing in boxing, I started to appreciate the value of knowledge and what differs man from animal. While others were tanning and relaxing during the summer, I was dedicating myself to studying. This includes not only high-school curricullum, but books from Kafka, Rousseau and Ayn Rand, in addition to some biographies on Stalin, Mao and Lenin.
      I taught myself Mathematics in High school and advanced to the final in the Norwegian Mathematical Competition at NTNU. I have around 100 solved problems on Project Euler and I have been profitable over 5000 bets on sports by using a primarily
      statistical approach. I'm also a previous amateur boxer and enjoy keeping myself in shape.
